# Sorting Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of basic sorting and searching algorithms in C++.

## Algorithms Completed
- Selection Sort

## Time Complexity
- Selection Sort: O(n²)

## How it works
Selection Sort finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.

More algorithms will be added soon.
