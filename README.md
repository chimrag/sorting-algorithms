# Sorting Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of classic sorting algorithms written in C++.  
These algorithms are fundamental in learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA),  
and are commonly asked in coding interviews and college exams.

## 📂 Algorithms Implemented

### ✔ Selection Sort
- Finds the minimum element in the unsorted part  
- Places it at the correct position (front)  
- Time Complexity: **O(n²)**  
- Space Complexity: **O(1)**

### ✔ Bubble Sort
- Repeatedly compares adjacent elements  
- Largest element “bubbles up” to the end after every pass  
- Time Complexity: **O(n²)**  
- Space Complexity: **O(1)**
